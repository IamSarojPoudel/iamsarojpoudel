I'm a software engineer who enjoys building reliable, scalable systems. I like to understand how different components work together and find ways to make them more efficient.

I work across the full stack - from backend services to mobile apps, and I'm always learning new technologies. Right now, I'm focusing on AI/ML development, trying to solve complex problems with data-driven approaches.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and following good engineering practices. I'm always excited to work on challenging problems and contribute to projects that make a real difference.
